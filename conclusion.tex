\chapter{Discussion}
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item Summarize the SLLN for semiparametric U-Statistics
	\item Discussion of main assumptions and examples of kernels $\phi$ and censoring models $m$
	\item Future (or perhaps in this thesis): Transfer that property to Prof. Dikta's new estimator using stochastic equivalence
	\item Future: CLT based on \cite{bose2002asymptotic}
\end{itemize}
